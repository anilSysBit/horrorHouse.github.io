# use Box Buffer Geometry for Custom Architecture
for making the custom geometry you should use BoxBufferGeometry 'cause it is much easier for the computer to perform rather than use the BoxGeometry Direct form the custorm purpose.

-> After making the array of your coordinates and faces of the geometry you sould add your data to setAttribute method

eg:- geometry.setAttribute('position',positonArray);


# Custom value setter library (dat.gui) state changer of geometrical instances
